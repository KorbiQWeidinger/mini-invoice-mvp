# Developer Rules

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15 application with TypeScript, Supabase backend, Preline UI components, and a semantic color token theming system. Focus on clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** with App Router and Turbopack
- **TypeScript**
- **Supabase**
- **Preline UI** for component library
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **React**

## Very Important Rules

You must ALWAYS follow these rules. At the end of each task, ask yourself if you followed these rules. If you did not, refactor the code to follow these rules.

- You must use preline components for everything. You must search the web for how preline components work. Create reusable preline components in /components/ui and use them in the project.
- You must use icons from lucide-react! Never generate icons yourself.
- You must use semantic color tokens for everything. The color tokens are in /app/globals.css. Never use color values directly. Add new tokens if needed.
- Do not use default exports
- Functions must not have more than 30 LOC
- Component definitions should be short, simple, and focused. Don't repeat yourself and extract small reusable components whenever applicable.
- If you find code that does not follow these rules, refactor it to follow these rules.
